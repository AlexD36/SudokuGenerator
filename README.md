Also one of my older project. The "SudokuGenerator" is a C++ application designed to generate and solve Sudoku puzzles. 
Sudoku is a popular logic-based number puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, 
each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
